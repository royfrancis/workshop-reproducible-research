Jupyter Notebook extensions are add-ons that can increase the functionality of
your notebooks. Extensions include themes, editors, git support, renderers and
much more. The most user-friendly way of managing extensions is via the
Extension Manager available in the Jupyter lab interface. You can access it by
clicking the puzzle piece icon in the left sidebar.

> **Warning!** <br>
> Note that the extension manager contains a disclaimer warning you that
> these third-party extensions are not reviewed for vulnerabilities which
> means that you should be careful about what extensions you install.

You can use the search field to perform a free text search for available
extensions, then click 'Install' to install an extension. Not that in some
cases you will be prompted to install additional packages.

While an in-depth listing of available extensions is well beyond the scope
of this tutorial we offer this list of a few extensions that are of particular
relevance to this course:
